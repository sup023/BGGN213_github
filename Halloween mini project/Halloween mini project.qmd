Today we will examine 538 Halloween "match-up" data. 

First I have to get my data into R 

```{r}
candy <- read.csv("candy-data.csv", row.names = 1)
head(candy)
```

Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

85 types. 
```{r}
dim(candy)
```


Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

38 fruity candy types.

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?
A: Sour Patch Kids

```{r}
candy["Sour Patch Kids", ]$winpercent
```

Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?
```{r}
candy["Twix", ]$winpercent
```
Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?
```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```
```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
```
Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

Winpercent is not between 0 and 1 because it's in percentage. 

Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

It represent it is candy chocolate or not 

Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values
```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?
No
Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?
Yes it is higher than fruit candy
```{r}
choc.ind <- as.logical(candy$chocolate)
fruit.ind <- as.logical(candy$fruity)

choc.win <- candy[choc.ind,]$winpercent
fruit.win <- candy[fruit.ind,]$winpercent

mean(choc.win)
mean(fruit.win)
```


Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?
It is significant because p-value is less than 0.5
```{r}
t.test(choc.win, fruit.win)
```
Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```
Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?
```{r}
head(candy[order(-candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```

Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```
Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?
```{r}
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols)
```

```{r}
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```

- Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?
A: Sixlets
- Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?
A: Starburst

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 15)
```

Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

-Toostie Roll Midgies

Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

Nik L Nip		
Nestle Smarties			
Ring pop		
Hershey's Krackel	
Hershey's Milk Chocolate

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(pricepercent, reorder(rownames(candy), pricepercent)) +
  geom_segment(aes(yend = reorder(rownames(candy), pricepercent), 
                   xend = 0), col="gray40") +
    geom_point()
```

```{r}
library(corrplot)
```

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```
Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

A: Fruity and chocolate

Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?
A: chocolate and winpercent

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[, 1], pca$x[, 2], 
     xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2", 
   )
```
```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```
```{r}
# Make a new data-frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)

p
```

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```
```{r}
library(plotly)
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplotly(p)
```
```{r}
par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")
```

Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you? 

A: Fruity is the most positive variables in PC1. Fruity, hard, bar is picked up positive. 
Yes this makes sense because the most anti-correlated variables were chocolate and fruity.
