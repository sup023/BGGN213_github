#PDB statistics
```{r}
stats <-read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
head(stats)
```

In uniprot there are 251600,768 proteins.
```{r}
round(183201/251600768*100, 2)
```

```{r}
rm.comma <- function(x){
  as.numeric( gsub(",", "", x))
}

pdbstats <- apply(stats, 2, rm.comma)
```
Will add the rownames from the original table 

```{r}
rownames(pdbstats) <- rownames(stats)
pdbstats
```




Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.
93.16%

```{r}
totals <- apply(pdbstats, 2, sum)
round(totals/totals["Total"] * 100, 2)
```
Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?
The resolution is too low 2Å

Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

308

Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

And a nicer pic colored by secondary structure with catalytic active site ASP 25 shown in each chain

# Using the bio3d package 

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```
```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom$resid)
```

```{r}
aa321( pdb$atom$resid[ pdb$calpha ] )
```
#Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 
198
#Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 
HOH, MK-1 
#Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 
2


# Predicting functional motions of a single structure


Run a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) 

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
modes <- nma(adk)
plot(modes)
```

```{r}
mktrj(modes, file="modes.pdb")
```
